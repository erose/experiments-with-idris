Idris mysteries:
  - why doesn't this definition of cong work? (renamed so as not to shadow cong)

cong_ : { f : a -> b } -> x = y -> f x = f y
cong_ (x = x) = (f x = f x)

  - It doesn't work because (x = x) is not an INSTANCE of the type x = y, it's a different type. You can't pattern-match against a type.


  - why doesn't this function work?

    -- Utility function for constructing a word state from a string.
    newWordState : (s : String) -> Nat -> WordState (length s) (length s)
    newWordState s guessesRemaining = MkWordState s (fromList $ unpack s)
